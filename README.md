This is the temp repositiory to implement genomic selection.

Multi-trait genomic selection (MTGS)
MTGS assings weights to different traits relative to their economic importance: index selection

Classical index selection only optimizes genetic gain in the next generation and requires optimizing nonlinear breeding objectives
Approach maximizing certain traits while keeping others within desirable ranges.
LAS = look-ahead selection algorithm
LAMS = look-ahead mate selection 
MTLAS is more effective balancing multiple traits compared with index selection
GEBV = genomic estimated breeding values are calculated as the sum of the estimated marker effects
Goal 1
Development of models to improve the accuracy of GEBV prediction
These studies have been focused on selecting the parents of the next generation by defining new quantitative selection merits
Mate selection optimize the contribution of potential parents to the next generation based on maximizing a desired breeding objective
The optimization is performed with respect to the next generation
LAMS optimize parental contributions with respect to grand-progeny (two generations in the future)
ST-GS = single trait genomic selection
Pareto efficiency is a state where resources are allocated in the most efficient manner
The accuracy of genomic prediction critically depends on the level of relatedness between the training population and the testing population
The use of multivariate linear mixed models in genetic evaluations provides a basis for inference about traits' integration
